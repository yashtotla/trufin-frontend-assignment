Running asynchronous tasks with a concurrency limit can be useful when you don't want to overwhelm an API or want to keep resource usage below the maximum threshold. Some popular javascript libraries that allow to fetch multiple resources in parallel with a concurrency limit

- [p-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-limit)
- [async](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/)
